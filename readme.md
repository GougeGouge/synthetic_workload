# DBtune synthetic workload

### DBtune

[DBtune](www.dbune.com) is an automated service that helps DBAs and DevOps engineers to perform parameter tuning of PostgreSQL (PG) instances. 
If you have several instances to optimize DBtune facilitates a tedious task that takes time and effort so that DBAs and DevOps engineers can focus on other pressing matters instead.
By running optimized PG instances users end up needing fewer computing resources, saving a ton of cloud credits and CO2.


### Synthetic workload
This wiki offers a hands-on training and the opportunity to try the [DBtune platform](app.dbune.com) to tune a postgres instance. 
You will be offered to tune the instance under a synthetic workload provided by this framework.

To get started with this hands-on follow the steps in the [wiki](https://github.com/dbtuneai/synthetic_workload/wiki).
